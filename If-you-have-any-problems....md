If you have any critical problems like:
- Message boxes with some errors/exceptions
- Your NES Mini doesn't show any new games
- Led never goes out or flashes repeatedly

Do the following steps:
- Download special debug version, you can find it on "releases" pages.
- Run it as usual. Console window with some verbose info will open.
- Try to reproduce problem
- Archive the whole hakhi2 directory (there will be debug log and temp directory)
- Send it to me. You can contact me via clusterrr@clusterrr.com.
